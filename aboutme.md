title: About me
---

I am a research assistant at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya. I also work in the [COVID research group]"https://covid.eng.pdn.ac.lk" at University of Peradeniya. I focus on research related to two domains in my research assistantship; computer vision and smart grids. I recently graduated from the [University of Peradeniya] http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/ with a B.Sc specializing in Electrical & Electronic Engineering.

I spend my leisure time reading books, writing [(Medium)] https://medium.com/@jhassan.tck13 and doing Fretwork. See my works here. I enjoy playing both outdoor sports like football and basketball, and board games. 

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be advised by many fantastic researchers. Currently I am working with the [faculty] https://covid.eng.pdn.ac.lk/people/ in the Covid Research group on the potential of AI for COVID-19 related applications. I am carrying out research related to Smart Grids under my undergraduate supervisors.
                                                                                                                                                   
              Previously, for my final year undergraduate research project, I worked with 
                Prof. <a href="http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/deee/staff/academic/prof.jb.ekanayake/profile.php">Janaka Ekanayake</a>,
