I focus on research related to two domains in my research assistantship; computer vision and smart grids. I recently graduated from the [University of Peradeniya] http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/ with a B.Sc specializing in Electrical & Electronic Engineering.

I spend my leisure time reading books, writing [(Medium)] https://medium.com/@jhassan.tck13 and doing Fretwork. See my works here. I enjoy playing both outdoor sports like football and basketball, and board games.
